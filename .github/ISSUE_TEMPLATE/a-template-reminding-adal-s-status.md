This library, ADAL for Python, will no longer receive new feature improvements. Instead, use the new library [MSAL for Python](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python).

*    If you are starting a new project, you can get started with the MSAL Python docs for details about the scenarios, usage, and relevant concepts.
*    If your application is using the previous ADAL Python library, you can follow this migration guide to update to MSAL Python.
*    Existing applications relying on ADAL Python will continue to work.
