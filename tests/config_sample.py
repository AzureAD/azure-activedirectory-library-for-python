    # Getting token with username and passwords is the simple method.  You need to create an Azure
    # Active Directory and a user.  Once you have done this, you can put the tenant name, username
    # and password combination here.
    #
    # Note: You need to attempt to login to the user at least once to create a non-temp password.
    #       To do this, go to http://manage.azure.com, sign in, create a new password, and use
    #       the password created here.

    # To use client credentials (Secret Key) you need to:
    # Create an Azure Active Directory (AD) instance on your Azure account
    # in this AD instance, create an application.  I call mine PythonSDK http://PythonSDK
    # Go to the configure tab and you can find all of the following information:

    # Click on 'View Endpoints' and Copy the 'Federation Metadata Document' entry.
    # The root + GUID URL is our authority.
    "authority" : "https://login.microsoftonline.com/ABCDEFGH-1234-1234-1234-ABCDEFGHIJKL",

    #       permissions to that service.  At this time Azure does not have this in the portal for
    #       Azure Resource Management.
    #       Here is an example using POSH (Powershell) Tools for Azure to grant those rights.
    #           Switch-AzureMode -Name AzureResourceManager
    #           Add-AzureAccount # This will pop up a login dialog
