token entry file naming, and referencing (can't use . like js). Also do not duplicate the file nam constants
ask rich about the exception raising, and related error log, and adal specifc exceptions
port over the tokencache 
get rid of the __init__
refactoring out the common token steps in token_request.py say:
    a. Look for it cache
    b. common logging after the token request
fix up the naming of "token_response" when it should just be a "token"
consolidate exception types, rename with AAD, and see it has good pattern
authentication_parameters.py has callback, lots of them

merge 2 pylintrc files

consider the field access safeness

expose same set of properties say, for authority: 
    d:\sdk\adal-python\adal\oauth2_client.py::def _get_user_id(self, id_token):

checkout all "[]" usages for whether this field could be missing

check out the best python method signature design

need to expose an enumeratable from token cache?

cache persistence: we need to check whether the cache got changed before save it
fix a xplat bug that loading azuerprofile.json fails for the BOM

Code review explicit notes
a. concurrent support
b. catch at root vs catch-rethrow?
c. do not forget authentication_parameters.py
d. test federated account
e. get vs []
